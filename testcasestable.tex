R7: Warning creation. & \textcolor{BurntOrange}{Partially accomplished} Everything works fine excepts for a minor bug. We made a test case consisting in inserting a meeting from 22.00p.m. to 23.00p.m. in Busto Arsizio and a meeting from 2.00a.m. to 3.00a.m. in Puglia on the following day, obviously the insertion should be prevented due to the impossibility to cover the distance between the meetings in just 3 hours, but this doesn't happen, the second meeting is accepted by the system.  \\

R14: Some settings regarding the navigation profile, such as choosing the preferred means of transport&\textcolor{BurntOrange}{Partially accomplished} The unique preference the user can manage regards the travel means and in particular a prevalence order of them. This leads to a low level of customization for the users. Moreover the prevalence order prevent a user avoiding to adopt a specific travel mean, indeed it is not excluded but at most it is placed below other transports.   \\
