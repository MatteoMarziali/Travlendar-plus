As soon as Jon receives  an email from the other members of the Night's Watch, he doesn't wait and, as always, he opens Travlendar+ in order to set up the scheduled the important Meeting for saturday.
He logs into the application inserting his credentials (see use case \autoref{tab:login}) and then from the Homepage he starts creating the new Meeting (see use case \autoref{tab:meetingcreationtab}).
The application suggests an optimal route using the car, as it is the fastest way to get to The Wall from Winterfell where he is currently staying.
Unfortunately, Jon doesn't own a car, nor does he know what a car is, in fact he knows nothing. 
He deletes the Meeting straightaway (see use case \autoref{tab:deletemeetingtab}) and navigates through the app reaching the "Preferences set up" page at once.
Here he deactivates all impossible means of transport (see use case \autoref{tab:activatedeactivatemean}) and leaves as active only On Foot and By Horse options.
He then recreates the exact same Meeting as before and this time the system comes up with a feasible travel.
Satisfied, Jon closes the app and goes on hunting rabbits.
