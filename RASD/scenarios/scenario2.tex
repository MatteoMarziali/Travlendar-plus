The following day, a raven from Dragonstone arrives at Winterfell, Jon's heart starts beating faster as soon as he notices the Targaryen sigil.
It's Danaerys who is asking for a date with him on saturday night.
Jon, unable to decide whether he can make it for both the appointments on time, lets his favourite companion decide it for him.
He starts up Travlendar+ and creates the meeting (see use case \autoref{tab:meetingcreationtab}).
Unfortunately, the ride from Dragonstone to The Wall is long, and a warning appears on Jon's app stating that he is not going to be able to make it on time for both the meetings and a reschedule proposal is made. 
Jon Solves the conflict (see use case \autoref{tab:warningsolving}) and the warning disappears.
Since he was longing for a date with Dany, Jon decides to add a Reminder (see use case \autoref{tab:reminderaddition}) to the event in order for him to have enough time to suit up for the special date.
