	Considering the domain of our application, we  decided to integrate in our project some software components to create an easier and more powerful product. 
	\\In order to provide an excellent navigation service, we thought to adopt the Google Maps API, to retrieve the user location through the Google Maps' servers and databases. 
	\\In addition, we noticed that the most complex computations which Travlendar+ should perform are those related to calculating the best route. This idea suggested us to use the APIs of several travel mean sharing services, such as Mobike or CarToGo, 
	to support this crucial phase. We are sure that these APIs are going to allow us to query the databases and to retrive precise information in the quickest and easiest way.
	\\The same reasoning is applicable to forecast, needed to avoid certain routes in case of particular wheater conditions, indeed wheater information from a specific provider are supposed to be rietrieved through its APIs. 
	\\Finally, APIs of public transport societies are required to retrieve real time information about buses,trains and taxis and to mantain the app up to date with relevance to all the related news, for instance about strikes.
