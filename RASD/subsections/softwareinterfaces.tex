	Considering the domain of our application, we have decided to integrate in our project some software components to create an easier and more powerful product. 
	\\In order to provide an excellent navigation service, we thought to adopt the Google Maps API, to retrieve the user location through the Google Maps' servers and databases. 
	\\In addition, we have noticed that the most complex computations which Travlendar should effort are those related to calcuating the best route. This idea suggested us to use the API of several travel mean sharing services, such as Mobike or CarToGo, 
	to support this crucial phase. We are sure that these APIs would have allowed us to query the databases and to retrive precise information in the quickest and easiest way.
	\\The same reasoning is applicable to forecast, needed to avoid certain routes in case of particular wheater, indeed wheater information from a specific provider are supposed to be rietrived through its APIs. 
	\\Finally, APIs of public transport agencies are required, to retrieve real time information about buses,trains and taxis and to mantain the app. up to date with relevance to all the related news, for instance about strikes.
