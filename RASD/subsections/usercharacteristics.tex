According to our idea, Travlendar+ does not have a specific customers range, it is supposed to be used by both male and female, whatever their age is.
Obviously, considering that we intend to produce a mobile application, people who want to use Travlendar+ should be familiar with a portable device like a smartphone or a tablet. 
For sure, users should respect several requirements due to the travel means they are going to take. For instance, when cars are selected as active in the means of transport list, the user is supposed to have a valid driver licence, taking the bus is allowed only with an appropriate ticket.
Moreover, users interested in dealing with Travlendar+ services must have an e-mail address, primarily due to register and authenticate themselves, secondly to use the delay notification function.
