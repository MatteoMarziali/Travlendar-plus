\begin{itemize}
\item Simple User Interface:
The user interface has to be as simple and intuitive as possible, the application should allow an average user to set up an account and start using the application understanding its functionality in no more than a dozen minutes.

\item Portability. The client has to be compatible to all the major hardware and software platform on the market, this is accomplished using the web application solution presented early.

\item Performance. The application should be able to calculate shortest paths very quickly in order to let the user choose the one that better fits his needs right after setting up the meeting.

\item Reliability. The system should be able to guarantee the service independently of the time, 24/24, 7/7. Thus, the used services should be always available, however, since this is not a critical application, brief unavailability could be acceptable.

\item Data integrity, consistency and availability. System data have to be always accessible. Hence the system should always provide a reliable access to them in normal condition. They also have to be duplicate in order to avoid data losses in case of system fault. 

\item Security. Hashed password should be stored in the database in order to guarantee a high level of privacy to the users. Sensible data such as meetings details will probably be stored locally on the user device, a possible encryption might be considered but it's not a priority
