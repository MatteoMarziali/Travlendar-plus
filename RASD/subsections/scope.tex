Even if we are very confident about the success of our idea, initially, Travlendar+ will have a restricted domain, indeed we will experiment it only in the Italian city of Milan. 
In order to provide the most complete assistance, Travlender+ will suggest different paths and a wide range of transports such as bike, even shared, your car or a shared one, taxi, bus, and also.. your feet!
It goes without saying that to organize this kind of service in the most valuable way we must interact with a huge number of local institutions which provide different services in town.
