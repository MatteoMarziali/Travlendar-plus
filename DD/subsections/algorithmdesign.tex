\subsection{Warning generator algorithm}

One of the fundamental identified algorithms is the one that checks whether a newly added meeting can generate a warning with the previous meeting, the following, or both of them.
If it's one of those cases a warning containing the correct meetings is created in the system (see createWarning method in the code).
\\
The pseudocode of the algorithm is provided below:
