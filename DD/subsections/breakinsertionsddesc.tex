The break insertion runtime view is conceptually similar to the meeting insertion even if it involves less components and requires less controls. \\
When the user express the intention to insert a break, the preferences manager bean is called and manages to submit the user a form to get the break details. At this point, the preferences manager sends this details to the meeting evaluator which plays the role to search conflicts by verifying overlaps.\\ If it finds conflicts, it generates a conflict in the system otherwise nothing is done and in both cases the user is notified. \\ Please note that in the break insertion the only possible conflict refers to a situation where the new break overlaps completely one or more meetings which has the only implication of generating a conflict in the system. \\
