This component diagram, as the title suggests, is designed to deeply analyze the atomic components of the application server, since they are the core of the whole architecture in terms of complexity of computations and relevance in assolving functional requirements. \\
Since this diagram aims to explain almost every logical component and their interactions, it is quite complex and difficult to be read and understood, for this reason we attached below some tables to further clearify both the interactions and the role of each component. \\
