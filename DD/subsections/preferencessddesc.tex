The preferences insertion runtime view aims to provide a representation of how a user can set up all the customizable settings of Travlendar+.\\ 
Firstly, it is relevant to notice that the breaks preferences are considered in a different sequence diagram. \\ 
This said, the user still can activate or deactivate travel means, to allow or prevent them to be used in the routes for his meetings, clearly at least one travel mean must be activated, this explains the travel means deactivation loop and its condition. \\
Moreover a user can eventually activate or deactivate routes, in the sense that a user can decide to have the fastest route, the shortest route etc. As far as the routes are concerned, there arenn't constraints referring to have at least one route activated, indeed in that case it is expected that a default route is adopted.
