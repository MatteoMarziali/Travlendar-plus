The Signup and Login runtime view includes, as the name suggests, both the signup and the login (and also the password recovery), since they are intended related concepts with a slight impact on the application behaviour. \\
A registered user who wants to log in himself must fill the login form until he insert correctly his username and password, at this point the Login manager bean manages to identify him and then to load his data. \\
On the other hand, when an unregistered user shows the intention to sign up himself, the Signup manager bean is called and submits the user a registration form, and, once the user has completed and sent back it, manages to verify the consistency of the inserted data. \\ 
If a registered user has forgotten his password, the Login manager component is called and requires the user email to send him a link where a new email can be created, then the login can eventually be performed by the user. \\
