This section of the document gives a detailed view of the physical and logical infrastructure of the system-to-be. 
\\It provides the different types of view over the sysyem as well as the description of the main components and their interactions.
\\A top down approach will be adopted for the description of the architectural design of the system:
\begin{description}
\item[Section \ref{higharch}] A description of high-level components and their interactions.
\item[Section \ref{componentview}] A detailed insight of the components described in the previous section.
\item[Section \ref{deploymentview}] A set of indications on how to deploy the illustrated components on physical tiers.
\item[Section \ref{runtimeview}] A thorough description of the dynamic behaviour of the software with diagrams for the key-functionalities.
\item[Section \ref{componentinterfaces}] A description of the different types of interfaces among the various described components.
\item[Section \ref{archstyles}] 
A list of the architectural styles, design patterns and paradigms adopted in the design phase.
\item[Section \ref{otherdecisions}] A list of all other relevant design decisions that were not mentioned before.
