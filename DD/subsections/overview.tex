This section of the document gives a detailed view of the physical and logical infrastructure of the system-to-be. 
\\It provides the different types of view over the sysyem as well as the description of the main components and their interactions.
\\A top down approach will be adopted for the description of the architectural design of the system:
\begin{description}
\item[Section \ref{higharch}] \textbf{High-Level components}: A description of high-level components and their interactions.
\item[Section \ref{componentview}] \textbf{Component View}: A detailed insight of the components described in the previous section.
\item[Section \ref{deploymentview}] \textbf{Deployment view}: A set of indications on how to deploy the illustrated components on physical tiers.
\item[Section \ref{runtimeview}] \textbf{Runtime View}: A thorough description of the dynamic behaviour of the software with diagrams for the key-functionalities.
\item[Section \ref{componentinterfaces}] \textbf{Component Interfaces}: A description of the different types of interfaces among the various described components.
\item[Section \ref{archstyles}] \textbf{Selected Architectural styles and patterns}: 
A list of the architectural styles, design patterns and paradigms adopted in the design phase.
\item[Section \ref{otherdecisions}] \textbf{Other design decisions}: A list of all other relevant design decisions that were not mentioned before.
