The meeting creation runtime view, explained through an apposite sequence diagram, summarize all the computations needed to allow the creation of a meeting. \\
This scenario starts when a user select to create a meeting, this intention is dispatched by the application server to the Meeting manager bean, which is in charge of submitting a meeting creation form to the user and holding its resubmission. \\
Taken the meeting details, the Meeting manager sends them to the conflict checker, this component must control whether a meeting is feasible or not, considering both the breaks set by the user and other meetings. \\
To assolve this function, this bean needs thee break details from the preferences manager bean and some routes from the google maps server in order to evaluate the time among adjacent meetings. \\
Collected the information, the conflict checker computes to find overlaps and if it is not the case, the negative verification outcome reaches the user, who is notified about the correct insertion. In case overlaps are present, if they are caused by conflicts with breaks that can be flexibly rescheduled during their range not to be overlapping the meeting will be accepted without any consequence. Otherwise, if either this is not the case or the conflict is beetween meetings, the conflict checker will generate a conflict and notify the user through the meeting manager.
