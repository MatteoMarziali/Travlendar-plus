The main focus of our system design phase will be to create an application capable of reaching the vast majority of users. Thus the architecture must be designed with the intent of being maintainable and extensible, also forseeing future changes.
It should also be flexible enough in order to make future integration of features or adaptations and deploy on other type of platforms and devices as easy as possible. This document aims to drive the implementation phase so that cohesion and decoupling are increased in full measure. In order to do so, individual components must not include too many unrelated functionalities and they should reduce interdependency between one another.
